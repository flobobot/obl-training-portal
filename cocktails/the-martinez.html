  <h2>Garnish</h2>
  <p>Lemon twist (+ express and discard orange peel)</p>
  <h2>Pro Tip</h2>
  <p>Think of the Martinez as a bridge between a Manhattan and a Martini — the Maraschino gives it elegant sweetness. Stir with care, if you get a hint of gummy bear you know that you have hit the spot. Some say to add a drop of orange bitters in the ice water when chilling the glass is the key to an outstanding result.</p>
  <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
  <p>Widely considered the precursor to the Martini, the Martinez dates back to the mid-1800s and showcases how gin-based cocktails evolved. It is a bold and simultaneously fragile masterpiece. It encapsulates everything that a sweet tooth hates, and everything they love - and vice versa. I would go as far as to say that this particular cocktail made me more curious about cocktails in general. En masse, a great way to endure even the most tedious of company. In moderation, a great way to start an evening. Or finish it.</p>
