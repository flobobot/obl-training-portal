  <p>Nick & Nora</p>
  <h2>Garnish</h2>
  <p>Lemon twist or olive</p>
  <h2>Pro Tip</h2>
  <p>A ‘wet’ Martini uses a higher proportion of vermouth. It’s smoother, more aromatic, and more approachable for Martini newcomers.</p>
  <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
  <p>Winston Churchill famously preferred his Martini bone dry — but the wet version is now making a comeback as palates evolve. The difference is subtle, it’s still booze stirred with booze. Some may even say that … how did I get this drunk? I have seen battle hardened drinkers meet the creator with this surprisingly smooth concoction. Like most Martinis, the liquid should be chilled to sub-zero, which makes the pour a true experience. The viscosity of the liquid changes and you will feel like a true alchemist if done right.</p>
