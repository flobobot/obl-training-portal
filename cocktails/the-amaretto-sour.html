  <h1>The Amaretto Sour</h1>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Disaranno Amaretto: 40ml</li>
    <li>Lemon Juice: 25ml</li>
    <li>Sugar Syrup: 5ml</li>
    <li>Egg White: 20ml</li>
    <li>Rittenhouse: 20ml</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Method</h2>
  <p>Reverse dry-shake. Shake all ingredients without ice, then shake again with ice. Fine strain into a coupette, though some prefer it on the rocks.</p>
  <h2>Glassware</h2>
  <p>Coupette or Rocks</p>
  <h2>Garnish</h2>
  <p>Maraschino cherry and lemon sail</p>
  <h2>Pro Tip</h2>
  <p>Adding a bold rye whiskey like Rittenhouse offsets the sweetness of the Amaretto and gives structure.</p>
  <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
  <p>The Amaretto Sour has enjoyed a revival — especially when made in this modern whiskey-laced style, inspired by Jeffrey Morgenthaler’s version, which replaces overbearing sweetness with a sophisticated attitude. It is nothing short of genius - there really is no need to add sugar to anything based on Amaretto, instead add sharp boldness of an overproof bourbon and you will win the amateur’s and connoisseurs heart. Make sure to observe the reactions.</p>
