  <h1>The Perfect Manhattan</h1>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Bulleit Rye: 50ml</li>
    <li>Cocchi Di Torino: 12.5ml</li>
    <li>Dolin Dry Vermouth: 12.5ml</li>
    <li>Angostura Bitters: 2 - 3 dashes</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Method</h2>
  <p>Stir until properly diluted and silky. Julip strain into a chilled coupe.</p>
  <h2>Glassware</h2>
  <p>Coupette</p>
  <h2>Garnish</h2>
  <p>Maraschino cherry, orange peel aromatised and discarded</p>
  <h2>Pro Tip</h2>
  <p>The “Perfect” Manhattan uses both sweet and dry vermouths for a layered profile. Stir carefully to avoid over-dilution. Pour from hight - it adds drama to the process but also aerates the mixture, making it much smoother.</p>
  <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
  <p>The Manhattan dates back to 1870s New York — its rye roots give it a spicy backbone loved by purists. It used to be my go-to just to get to the maraschino cherry as quickly as possible. Now I like to savor the moment and the three sips to get to the cherry. Sometimes two.</p>
