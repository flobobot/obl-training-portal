<h1>The Classic Daiquiri</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2><ul class="ingredients">
<li>Plantarey 3yo Rum: 50ml</li>
<li>Lime: 20ml</li>
<li>Simple Syrup: 15ml</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method</h2><p>Hard shake all ingredients with ice and fine strain into a chilled glass.
</p>
<h2>Pro Tip</h2><p>Balance is everything: adjust lime and syrup depending on your rum’s sweetness, the Planteray has beautiful, subtle, notes of vanilla which elevate this concoction and add true sophistication. El Dorado (not in our repertoire, sadly) is my absolute favorite but do take note and get yourself a bottle of El Dorado and try it yourself. If you (or your customer) are into a more candy approach, try to sweeten this drink with some agave syrup instead of simps - careful with dosage - but the results are likely to blow their mind if you have a sweet tooth.
