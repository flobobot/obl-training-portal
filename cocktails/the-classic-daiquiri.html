  <h1>The Classic Daiquiri</h1>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Plantarey 3yo Rum: 50ml</li>
    <li>Lime: 20ml</li>
    <li>Simple Syrup: 15ml</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Method</h2>
  <p>Hard shake all ingredients with ice and fine strain into a chilled glass.</p>
  <h2>Glassware</h2>
  <p>Coupette, though I believe a Nick and Nora makes it look slicker.</p>
  <h2>Garnish</h2>
  <p>None or lime twist.</p>
  <h2>Pro Tip</h2>
  <p>Balance is everything: adjust lime and syrup depending on your rum’s sweetness, the Planteray has beautiful, subtle, notes of vanilla which elevate this concoction and add true sophistication. El Dorado (not in our repertoire, sadly) is my absolute favorite but do take note and get yourself a bottle of El Dorado and try it yourself. If you (or your customer) are into a more candy approach, try to sweeten this drink with some agave syrup instead of simps - careful with dosage - but the results are likely to blow their mind if you have a sweet tooth.</p>
  <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
  <p>The Daiquiri was invented in Cuba and famously loved by Ernest Hemingway, although he preferred a sugarless version with grapefruit juice - which frankly isn’t very nice. We’re here to enjoy drinks!

As you all know I am a massive fan of this drink and even though a hard purist, I do like the idea of some variations of this concoction, in particular the Rhubarb and Strawberry riff.
Replacing the sugar with our rhubarb and strawberry cordial, this drink can actually be elevated to another level and bodes well with some fruity additives. Be aware of its natural fragility and elegance. Getting the proportions wrong can easily turn this into a nightmare in a cup!</p>
