<pre># The Old Fashioned

### 🍸 Ingredients

- Bulleit Bourbon: 50ml
- Brown Sugar Syrup: 15ml
- Ango bitters: 1ml
- Orange bitters: 0.5ml

### 🧪 Method

Stir thoroughly with ice and strain over a single large cube in a rocks glass.

### 🥃 Glassware

Rocks

### 🍊 Garnish

Orange peel

### ✅ Pro Tip

Use cold, dense ice to control dilution. Brown sugar syrup adds rich depth vs. white, squeezing the peel over the drink will release its oils and therefore a distinct aroma into the drink, some gently wipe the rim of the glass with it.
