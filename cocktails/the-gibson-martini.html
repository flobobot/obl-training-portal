<h2>Method</h2>
<p>Stir with ice, strain into a chilled Nick &amp; Nora glass. ### 🥃 Glassware Nick &amp; Nora ### 🍊 Garnish Cocktail onion ### ✅ Pro Tip Keep onions fresh and chilled — they are the signature of this savory Martini variation. ### 💡 Did You Know? The Gibson is thought to be created by San Francisco businessman Walter D. K. Gibson in the late 19th century, who preferred an onion to an olive. Some say the idea of the cocktail onion as a garnish came from a cunning diplomat, who liked to stay sharp by adding an onion to be able to recognize his drink out of many on a tray being delivered on a tray amidst many, which in fact was just water.  Cunning, though I believe he would have been a much better diplomat with gin and vermouth in his system.</p>
